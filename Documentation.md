/*

- I designed the UX considering myself as the user for this app but there are many other ways to approach it too.

- Cocoapods was the third-party framework manager with SDWebImage for image caching.

- MVVM isn't inherently better than MVC and I felt MVC was more suited for this task.

- I used the notification center for view updates as it is a simple task but if it were more complicated I would use delegates more as that is a lot more useful in keeping track of what's happening and for testing.

- I built this using programmatic UI but I feel storyboards are worthwhile too, with them being a lot more useful for when an engineer needs POCs fast.

- I built a small watch app in the process of learning SwiftUI and it takes very little code to build something compared to UIKit
